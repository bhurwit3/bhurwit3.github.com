	<h2><a id="rd">What is Responsive Design?</a></h2>
	 
		
	<p>Responsive design is the process of creating a webpage which is attractive and 
	    effective on a variety of devices, browsers, and screen sizes. This can be achieved
		by using proper mark-up which is supported by all major browsers, and also by using
		style sheets which account for changes in screen size.</p>
		
	<h2><a id="view">What should I be seeing?</a></h2>
	
	<p>If you are viewing this page on a full-size desktop screen, you should see the title
	     centered, with a horizontal navigation bar centered beneath it. All other text should
		 be centered further below and there should be significant space on either side of the 
		 page content. On a smaller computer screen, the page will appear similarly, although
		 with less padding on either side. If viewing this page on a tablet (600px), you should 
		 see the navigation bar now vertically displayed on the left side of the page. The title 
		 will still be centered, but the text (content) of the page will be on the right side.
		 On a smartphone (300px), you should see a small title with navigation (no longer inline)
		 directly underneath. Text will be located directly below the navigation.</p>
		 
	<h2><a id="block">What is a blockquote?</a></h2>
		
	<p>A blockquote is a piece of text that is given margins and set within another piece of content
	    I asked local citizen Ron Numnutz for his opinion on blockquotes; he had the following to say
		<blockquote>"I don't much about the internet, but I do want my words to be featured prominently,
					much more so than any surrounding words," said Numnutz. "Ain't there a way to git 'er
					done without all the fuss?"
		</blockquote>
		With so much public pressure, it is obvious why the W3C has created the shortcut HTML tag for the 
		blockquote.
