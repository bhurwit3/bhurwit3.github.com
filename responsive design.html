<div id="content">

		
	<h2><a id="view">What should I be seeing?</a></h2>
	
	<p>If you are viewing this page on a full-size desktop screen, you should see the title
	     centered, with a horizontal navigation bar centered beneath it. All other text should
		 be centered further below and there should be significant space on either side of the 
		 page content. On a smaller computer screen, the page will appear similarly, although
		 with less padding on either side. If viewing this page on a tablet (800px), the title 
		 will now be on the left side in smaller text. The header will now be thinner with a light
		 bronze backgorund instead of the sepia image of sheep. The backgound image of the entire 
		 page is now a lighter diamond pattern. On a smartphone (300px), you should see a small title
		 with navigation (no longer inline)directly underneath. Text will be located directly below
		 the navigation and the background for the entire page is now entirely white.</p>
		 
	<h2><a id="block">What is a blockquote?</a></h2>
		
	<p>A blockquote is a piece of text that is given margins and set within another piece of content
	    I asked local citizen Ron Numnutz for his opinion on blockquotes; he had the following to say
		<blockquote><h3>"I don't much about the internet, but I do want my words to be featured prominently,
					much more so than any surrounding words," said Numnutz. "Ain't there a way to git 'er
					done without all the fuss?"
		</h3></blockquote>
		With so much public pressure, it is obvious why the W3C has created the shortcut HTML tag for the 
		blockquote.
	</p>

	<h2><a id="list">Nested Lists</a></h2>
	
	<p>In this section I am going to try some nested Lists. I will be using an unordered list to 
		show a few of my favorite bands, and an ordered list to show my favorite 
		albums by those bands.</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Black Sabbath
			<ol><li>Master of Reality</li>
				<li>Paranoid</li>
				<li>Black Sabbath</li></ol></li>
		<li>Junior Kimbrough
			<ol><li>Sad Days and Lonely Nights</li>
				<li>Meet Me in The City</li>
				<li>Do the Rump</li></ol></li>
		<li>The Rolling Stones
			<ol><li>Exile on Main Street</li>
				<li>Sticky Fingers</li>
				<li>Beggars Banquet</li></ol></li>
