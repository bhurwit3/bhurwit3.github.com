<h3>Scientists and the Cape</h3>

<div id="text">Many of the travel writers who visited the Cape were botanists by profession. Anders Sparrman and C.P. Thunberg were both students of Carl Linnaeus. Francis Masson and William Burchell were botanists as well. Classification was their specialty, and they tended to ascribe traits to the racial and cultural groups they encountered.</div>
